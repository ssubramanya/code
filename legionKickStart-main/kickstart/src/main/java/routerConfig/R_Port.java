/* Physical ports are connected as follows:
   Currently There are six Routers Supported.
   Everything is having a full mesh connection between them and
   each router has two ports connected with the naming convention as :
   <router_name>_<router_number><peer_router_number><link_number>
   So for router R1 to connect to router R2 and link number 0,
   the port numbers would be R1_120 on R1 and R2_210 on R2. */
